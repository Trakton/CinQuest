CinQuest
========

A game to help freshers to understand how the Centre of Informatics (CIn) works e what you can do there. It's a gamification of the current Survival Manual also created by the PET-Informática. Each step of the Manual will be transformed into quests of the game. Here is the original [Survival Manual](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~pet/wiki/index.php/Manual_de_Sobrevivência_do_CIn) available only in Portuguese.

The main objective of the project is to provide a minimal infrastructure for the development of the game and then make it Open Source so the community may be able to collaborate. This way we can offer an opportunity to learn a different platform, encouraging the collaboration and development of a project that the whole CIn community can participate.
